         AR Rehman has very inspirational <a class="ar-rehman-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman">history</a> which i think each music lover must read for inspiration.
        AR rehman mastered most of the musical instruments which was used to play in wastern country and thus he brought transformation to music in 80s by bringing new music style followed by new musical instruments which was really amazing to hear.He sung his first song in film Roja.

        <p class="para">
Nowadays,Most of the styles of song that is composition of songs are reprised that is older songs are reprised by playing with older composition.
For many songs it does not work well but for some song it works. In case of AR Rehman composition if we listen his any songs even after 2050 it always feels something new and thats the best thing of AR Rehman composition.No songs of AR Rehman should be reprised according to me.
